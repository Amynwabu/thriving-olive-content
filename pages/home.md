## WHY YOU NEED THIS COACHING

### The Challenge: You're Overthinking
You've mastered appearing okay. Your calendar is full, your smile is trained, your prayers have become sighs. You show up, hold it down, pour from an empty cup.

But privately? You're fighting in silence.
- You cry in bathrooms
- You overthink at night
- You scroll encouragement posts but still feel heavy
- This fog lingers despite devotionals, fasting, journaling

### The Pain Points You Whisper
"I just want peace."
"Is this how it's supposed to feel?"
"Why am I so tired?"
"If I pause, everything falls apart."
"Am I failing at something everyone else handles?"

### The Deeper Truth: You Feel Loved but Not Understood
You have loved ones around you, but they don't seem to get you. You don't want to open up for fear of being judged or called weak. Your faith is questioned.

Your spirit feels out of tune—like a vibrant song that now skips and glitches. You long for rhythm. For rest that's renewal, not just a nap.

### The Invitation: Thrive Without Apology
You were never meant to carry it all alone. You were never called to grind your way to wholeness.

In this 12-week space, you'll:
- Reset without guilt
- Realign without shame
- Focus on what truly matters
- Thrive without apology

Because **wholesomeness is your portion.**

## MEET YOUR COACH

**Dr. Ezinne Nnamdi-Louis**
Medical Doctor (MBBS) | Certified Coach | Founder of Thriving Olive

I know what it means to look polished and feel panicked inside. I once thought about disappearing from it all.

That's why I created this group coaching experience—to walk with women like you into rest, realignment, and revival.

I don't just coach. I've lived this. I'm walking proof that you can rise again and thrive.

## TESTIMONIALS

### "Your tips for handling feelings of inadequacy are very helpful"

"Thank you Dr for the wonderful session. It was inspiring. Your tips for handling feelings of inadequacy are very helpful. I'm certain I'll be bringing positive feedback. The highest point for me tonight was 'what's at stake if you don't pursue that goal.' Thank you ma'am. More oil on your head."

**– Esther, UK**

### "It's God-breathed"

"Just listened to this and I must say, it's God-breathed. Possibly God delayed my listening to this power-packed word so I can be encouraged in a time like this. I'm presently having it tough but I'm grateful cause I know God is working his purpose out. Thank you doc Ezinne for allowing God to use you in this beautiful way. May this oil never run dry? Amen."

**– Ruth, Nigeria**

### "Really insightful"

"Just finished listening! Really insightful, especially the part about consistency. May the anointing on you be refreshed every day by God, the ultimate source of all good things."

**– Dr. Ebehi, Ghana**
